Master of Puppets
Metallica

End of passion play
Crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

Needlework the way
Never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly
Ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

(Master, master, master, master)

Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies

Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries

Fix me

Hell is worth all that
Natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze
Drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too

Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
